                    it ideal for city riding, spirited backroad runs, and even highway cruising. The throttle response is precise, and the six-speed transmission ensures smooth gear 
                    shifts with a well-matched final drive ratio. The bike's lightweight and punchy engine create a lively and engaging ride, especially for those who appreciate strong

                    and modern aesthetics. The bike’s compact dimensions and clean design elements emphasize its lightweight nature while maintaining a striking road presence. Its color
